# Ball maze
This project consists of a 3D maze designed with the WPF-framework (Windows Presentation Foundation) for a school project in my second year of ICT.

The application is split into three parts.

## Part 1 (Opdracht1)
Target 1: Create a 3D maze with WPF and add a simple animation.

All the neccesary WPF components are added to create a maze. Board that can tilt, walls, lightsource and of course the ball with an animation. 

## Part 2 & 3 (Opdracht2)
Target 2: Add physics.
Target 3: Maze generation and solving of that maze.

The physics include: Acceleration(Gravity), friction and collision.

The generation is done with the Recursive Backtracking Algorithm. Using this method it is very easy to find a solution for the maze while generating it.

## Documentation
All documentation included are in dutch.
